			<br/>
			<br/>
It is a violation of law to place a Request in a false name or with an invalid credit card.

Fraudulent users will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

SUPPLIER RULES AND RESTRICTIONS
			<br/>
Additional terms of use will apply to your reservation and purchase of travel-related goods and services that you select. Please read these additional terms of use carefully. In particular, if you have made the purchase online, please ensure you read the full terms and conditions of carriage issued by the Supplier, which can be found on the Supplier’s platform. You agree to abide by the terms of use of purchase imposed by any supplier with whom you elect to deal, including, but not limited to, payment of all amounts when due and compliance with the supplier's rules and restrictions regarding availability and use of fares, products, or services.
			<br/>
			<br/>
We reserve the right to cancel your booking if full payment is not received in a timely fashion.
			<br/>
			<br/>
You acknowledge that some third-party providers offering certain services and/or activities may require you to sign their liability waiver prior to participating in the service and/or activity they offer. You understand that any violation of any such supplier's rules and restrictions may result in cancellation of your reservation(s), in your being denied access to the applicable travel product or services, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such reservation(s), and/or in our debiting your account for any costs we incur as a result of such violation.
			<br/>
			<br/>

			<br/>
			<br/>
PRIVACY
			<br/>
			cheQin.app believes in protecting your privacy. Please click here to review our current Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the platform, and, as stated above, is incorporated by reference, to understand our practices: Privacy Policy.
			<br/>
			<br/>
PAYMENT METHODS
			<br/>
The Booking Requests can be paid at the hotel directly or through a major credit card unless otherwise expressly stated. The total price will be billed in the currency indicated on the booking screen.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Some banks and credit card companies impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a booking from outside of the United States on a US credit card, your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee. This means the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on the platform. In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit card is located outside of the United States. Booking international travel may be considered to be an international transaction by the bank or card company, since cheQin.app may pass on your payment to an international travel supplier. The currency exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined solely by your bank on the day that they process the transaction. If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.
			<br/>
			<br/>
INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL
			<br/>
You are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, such as passports and visas (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and any other foreign entry requirements are met. cheQin.app has no special knowledge regarding foreign entry requirements or travel documents. We urge customers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements, and advisories issued by the relevant governments prior to booking travel to international destinations.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Health: Recommended inoculations for travel may change and you should consult your doctor for current recommendations before you depart (especially for the international travel). It is your responsibility to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements, obtain the recommended inoculations, take all recommended medication, and follow all medical advice in relation to your trip.
			<br/>
			<br/>
BY OFFERING RESERVATIONS FOR TRAVEL PRODUCTS TO PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, cheQin.app DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH POINTS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.
